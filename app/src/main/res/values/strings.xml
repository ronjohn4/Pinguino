        <b>What is Pinguino?</b>
        <p>Pinguino lets you share photos the same as IM or SMS but it inserts YOU into the photo
        like you were taking a Selfie.  Select Pinguino when you share a photo only when you want
        your image inserted, otherwise use IM or SMS.</p>
        <b>First Time Here?</b>
        <p>Easy, all you need to do is select a photo of YOU.  Use the menu to select a photo.
        The photo you select probably won\'t
        have a transparent background.  You will be asked to touch the background area to make
        it transparent.  That\'s it!  Next time you share a photo, you can select Pinguino and
        the IM you send will have you inserted.</p><br>
        <b>Can I change my photo?</b>
        <p>Sure!  Just use the menu again to select a new photo.  You will be asked to select the
        background again just like you did with your first photo.</p>
